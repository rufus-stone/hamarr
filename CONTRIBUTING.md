# Get involved!

## I have no idea what I'm doing!

Feel free to suggest changes, critique my code, request new features, or make pull requests.

This whole endeavour is as much an excuse for me to practice some C++ as it is an attempt to make something genuinely useful, so if you spot any glaring mistakes or code smells, please tell me!

Oh, and if you want to make a pull request, make sure to run clang-format first :)
