# Get involved!

## I have no idea what I'm doing!

Feel free to suggest changes, critique my code, request new features, or make pull requests.

This whole endeavour is as much an excuse for me to practice some C++ as it is an attempt to make something genuinely useful, so if you spot any glaring mistakes or code smells, tell me!
